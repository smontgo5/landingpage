Non-profits in the US spend $7.6 billion every year on marketing (websites, design, etc). Codhisattvas provides a space for non profits to post a project they need done (whether its a website, web app, mobile app, graphic design or marketing) and have developers and designers bid on and complete the projects pro-bono. This frees up time and money for non-profits to focus on their actual mission and gives developers/designers/marketers the opportunity to use their skills for social good and build their resume and credibility.

Codhisattvas also serves as a platform for Benefit Corporations and other Do Good Businesses to get projects completed significantly below market rates.  This allows businesses get quality work done at unbelievably low cost so they can focus on their mission.  It also allow Developers, Designers, and Marketers to get paid for contributing to projects that will benefit humanity.
